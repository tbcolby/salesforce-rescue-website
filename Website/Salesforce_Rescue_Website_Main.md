# WARP + CLAUDE BUILD PROMPT — SALESFORCE RESCUE WEBSITE

You are acting as a senior product strategist, direct-response copywriter, Salesforce Certified Technical Architect, and incident-response consultant.

Your goal is to help build, refine, and ship the **Salesforce Rescue** website as a high-conversion, long-form emergency services page for Salesforce catastrophes.

## Core Intent
This website is NOT:
- A generic consulting site
- A Salesforce implementation pitch
- A feature-focused SaaS landing page

This website IS:
- An emergency-response sales letter
- A “who do we call right now?” answer
- A calm, authoritative guide for stressed buyers
- A trust-building document for high-stakes situations

## Guiding Principles
When assisting with this build, always:
1. Optimize for clarity under stress
2. Speak in plain, human language (no jargon unless necessary)
3. Assume the reader is anxious, time-constrained, and risk-averse
4. Prioritize stabilization, containment, and judgment over features
5. Reinforce that this is senior-level, fixed-scope rescue work
6. Avoid hype, bravado, or marketing clichés
7. Use empathy first, authority second, offer third
8. Repeat CTAs with varied, intent-matched language
9. Treat Salesforce Support limitations as factual context, not criticism
10. Favor shipping over perfection

## Copy & Structure Rules
- Long-form, direct-response style (Dan Kennedy / Schneider inspired)
- Short paragraphs, scannable sections
- Frequent section headers
- CTAs embedded throughout the page
- No profanity on the website (motivation may be emotional, language must be professional)
- SEO-friendly phrasing without keyword stuffing

## What Success Looks Like
This page succeeds if:
- A distressed Salesforce admin, developer, RevOps leader, or executive reads it and feels understood
- The reader clearly understands when to call Salesforce Rescue
- The reader confidently schedules an Assessment Call
- The site can ship today and improve incrementally

## How to Help Going Forward
When making suggestions or edits:
- Prefer appending new sections over rewriting existing ones
- Make changes incrementally
- Explain *why* a change improves conversion or clarity
- Flag risks or overcomplication early
- Keep the site as a single, authoritative page unless explicitly asked otherwise

## When Salesforce Fails, The Business Feels It Immediately

When Salesforce is unstable, the impact isn’t abstract or technical — it’s immediate and visible.

Sales teams lose confidence in their pipeline.  
Executives stop trusting reports.  
Support teams can’t see customer history.  
Finance questions forecasts.  
Leadership asks whether the system can be trusted at all.

At this stage, the risk is no longer “a Salesforce problem.”  
It’s an operational, revenue, and credibility problem.

This is the moment most teams realize they don’t need *more features* — they need stability.

## The Hidden Cost of Waiting

Many Salesforce catastrophes get worse because teams hesitate.

They wait for:
- A Salesforce Support response
- An SI escalation
- An internal admin to “take another look”
- A deployment window that never quite comes

During that waiting period:
- Bad data spreads
- Automation continues to misfire
- Integrations retry and duplicate
- Users work around the system
- Trust erodes quietly

Salesforce Rescue is designed to shorten that window.

## Common Salesforce Emergency Search Scenarios (SEO)

Teams usually find Salesforce Rescue while searching for answers like:

- “Salesforce data loss recovery”
- “Salesforce deployment failed production”
- “Salesforce automation breaking records”
- “Salesforce flow infinite loop”
- “Salesforce support not responding”
- “Salesforce admin left company”
- “Salesforce integration down”
- “Salesforce reports wrong”
- “Salesforce CPQ broken”
- “Salesforce permission issues”

If you’re searching phrases like these, you’re likely already in a rescue scenario.

## Data Loss, Corruption, and Integrity Failures

Few Salesforce events create panic faster than data problems.

Common triggers include:
- Accidental mass deletes
- Faulty Data Loader imports
- Incorrect field mapping
- Duplicate record explosions
- Sandbox refreshes overwriting production assumptions
- Partial restores with unclear gaps
- Orphaned records breaking reporting

Data issues often coexist with automation and integration failures, which makes them especially dangerous.

Salesforce Rescue focuses on containment first — then clarity.

## Automation, Flow, and Apex Failures Under Pressure

Modern Salesforce orgs rely heavily on automation. When it breaks, everything downstream suffers.

Common automation emergencies:
- Infinite Flow loops
- CPU time limit errors
- Record lock conflicts
- Triggers firing unexpectedly
- Validation rules blocking critical saves
- Automations breaking integrations silently
- Changes deployed without test coverage

Salesforce Rescue intervenes to stabilize automation safely — not experiment in production.

## Deployment, Release, and CI/CD Breakdowns

Deployments fail most often when timing matters most.

Typical scenarios:
- Failed production deployments
- Hotfixes blocked by dependencies
- Profiles and permissions breaking access
- Metadata conflicts across environments
- Rollbacks not possible
- CI/CD pipelines stuck or misconfigured

These moments require senior judgment — not trial and error.

## Integration Failures and API Incidents

Integrations often fail quietly — until they don’t.

High-risk integration failures include:
- ERP sync outages
- API limit exhaustion
- Authentication token failures
- Middleware outages
- Duplicate record creation
- Partial syncs corrupting data
- No monitoring or alerting

Salesforce Rescue helps identify where truth breaks and stop the spread.

## Security, Access, and Compliance Incidents

Security issues don’t allow for learning curves.

Common triggers:
- Users seeing data they shouldn’t
- Users blocked from critical records
- Permission drift over time
- Guest user access misconfiguration
- Compliance audit panic
- Regulatory exposure (SOX, HIPAA, FINRA)

These situations demand careful, minimal-change intervention.

## Why “We’ll Be Careful” Isn’t a Plan

During emergencies, teams often freeze — afraid to make things worse.

That fear is rational.

Uncoordinated fixes often:
- Compound data damage
- Mask root causes
- Break integrations
- Create future incidents

Salesforce Rescue exists to bring controlled intervention when caution alone isn’t enough.

## How the Assessment Call Actually Helps

The assessment is not a sales pitch.

It’s a working session designed to:
- Establish what is truly broken
- Separate symptoms from causes
- Identify immediate containment steps
- Clarify risks of action vs inaction
- Decide whether rescue engagement makes sense

Many clients describe this as the moment “the fog lifts.”

## Calendly Scheduling (Immediate Next Step)

Assessment calls are scheduled via Calendly to remove friction and delay.

You’ll be able to:
- Choose the earliest available time
- Indicate urgency level
- Request same-day priority if available
- Share context before the call

For severe or time-critical Salesforce emergencies, same-day assessments may be available at a priority rate.

## If You’re Still Unsure

If you’re reading this page carefully, it usually means something important is at risk.

You don’t need to decide on a long engagement.
You don’t need to commit to a rebuild.
You don’t need to justify the call internally yet.

You just need clarity.
