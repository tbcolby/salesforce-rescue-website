## 🎯 REMAINING PRIORITY ITEMS

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)

1. **⚠️ VIDEO CREATION** (CRITICAL)

   - Line locations: 187, 240, 1528

3. **⚠️ Remove/Update Phone References** (CRITICAL)

### Phase 2 Enhancements

## 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT (For Tyler)

```
Hey, I'm Tyler. I founded Salesforce Rescue. 

I've been working with Salesforce for over 15 years, with deep expertise in emergency scenarios and complex technical architecture.

I have a track record of helping companies — both small and large — solve urgent Salesforce problems extremely quickly.

Whether you're dealing with data loss, automation failures, integration issues, or you're not even sure what's wrong... I'd love to help you get back on track.

This is a real conversation, not AI. Let's talk.
```

**Filming Tips**:
- Natural setting (home office, not corporate boardroom)
- Good lighting (face well-lit, no harsh shadows)
- Clear audio (use phone or computer mic, quiet environment)
- Look at camera (eye contact with viewer)
- Conversational tone (not scripted/stiff)
- 45-60 seconds max
- File format: MP4, 1920x1080 or 1280x720

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPACT

Based on Bob's expertise and framework:
- **Above-the-fold conversion**: Expect 20-30% improvement with video + proof elements
